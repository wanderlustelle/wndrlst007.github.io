  <h1 style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">👋 Hi, I’m Elle</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website!
    <br>
    👀 I’m interested in lots of things, but some of them are scuba diving, boxing, music (singing, songwriting, DJing), machine learning/AI, philanthropy, and entrepreneurship!
    <br>
    🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python, and Accessibility design.
    <br>
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that requires automating our personal lives.
    <br>
